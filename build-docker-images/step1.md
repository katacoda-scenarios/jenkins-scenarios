The environment has a Jenkins server running as a Docker Container. You can view the status using `docker ps`{{execute}}.

The command used to launch the container was:

`docker run -d -u root --name jenkins \
    -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
    -v /root/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home \
    jenkins:2.60.3-alpine`

All plugins and configurations get persisted to the host at _/root/jenkins_. Port 8080 opens the web dashboard, 50000 is used to communicate with other Jenkins agents. Finally, the image has an alpine base to reduce the size footprint.

####Â Load Dashboard

You can load the Jenkins' dashboard via the following URL https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

In the next steps, you'll use the dashboard to configure the plugins and start building Docker Images.
